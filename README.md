# YardCraneScheduling

This is the code for my M.Sc. Thesis mathematical model and algorithm that formulates the Yard Crane Scheduling Problem.

1. I have organized the code across 5 files.
2. Each file contains about 100 - 150 lines of code
3. The master_crane_model is the main file that recalls all the functions in the other files.
